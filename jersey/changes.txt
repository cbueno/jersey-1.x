release 0.3 (2007-10-xx)
- Fixed issue 8: apt tool silently overwrites existing web.xml by default
- Fixed issue 2: URI path matching should operate on the encoded path
  https://jersey.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=2
- Integrated JSR 311 API 0.3.
  The class javax.ws.rs.core.UriBuilder is implemented. This is the preferred
  way to create URIs.
  Method names on javax.ws.rs.core.UriInfo were modified, the string "URI"
  or "Uri" was removed.
  The methods javax.ws.rs.ext.EntityProvider#readFrom/writeTo take
  a MediaType as a paramater, which corresponds to the "Content-Type"
  HTTP header field.
- Correctly support the writing of responses for the method signature:
    void <method>(HttpRequestContext, HttpResponseContext)
  this includes the method signature for resources that implement the interface
  com.sun.ws.rest.api.core.WebResource.
  An entity may be directly written by the application by obtaining an 
  OutputStream from the HttpResponseContext.getOutputStream() method.
- New SPI com.sun.ws.rest.spi.resource.* replaces com.sun.ws.rest.spi.resolver.*
  Supports addition of new resource providers that are responsible for creating 
  resource class instances and managing their lifecycle. The provider for a 
  particular resource class is set via the ResourceFactory meta-annotation, 
  see com.sun.ws.rest.spi.resource.Singleton for an example of its usage. 
  Default lifecycle for resource class instances is per-request, the prior 
  behaviour can be obtained by annotating a resource class with 
  com.sun.ws.rest.spi.resource.Singleton. Resource class constructors with a 
  per-request lifecycle can now have the same parameters as methods annotated 
  with HttpMethod.

release 0.2.1 (2007-09-04)
- Fixed issue 4: Unsed jars required to be included in the class path for use 
  of certain entity providers
  https://jersey.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=4
- JsonFromJaxb example added to demonstrate using JSON representation 
  of JAXB based resources
- 'jersey-on-glassfish.xml' ant script added to distribution
  so that users can install jersey jars, docs and examples on GlassFish
- Simpler getting started document included.
- Fixed bug that caused matrix parameters to be decoded twice.
- JAXB beans can be serialized as JSON or XML using one HTTP method with
  a @ProduceMime({"application/xml", "application/json"}).
- For an HTTP method that produces more than one media type automatically
  select the appropriate media type according to what is acceptable. This
  enables a developer to implement one method for the returning of a JAXB 
  bean that can be serialized as XML or JSON.
- Rename the zip of the Jersey respository from 'jersey-src' to 
  'jersey-snapshot'.
- Include zip of 311 src and Jersey src in the lib directory of the 
  distribution to faciliate easier debugging.
- Fixed bug in light weight HTTP server container that caused query parameters
  to be decoded twice and incorrectly extracted from the URI query string.
- JSON entity providers added to support JSONArray and JSONObject 
  entities from Jettison.

release 0.2 (2007-07-19)
- include Allow header in a 405 (Method Not Allowed) response.
- support by default OPTIONS request if OPTIONS is not implemented.
- support by default HEAD request if HEAD is not implemented by calling GET 
  and removing the entity.
- fixed WADL generation mixing up produce/consume information when generating
  responses.
- fixed WADL generation not correctly determining the HTTP method from 
  @HttpMethod Java method name.
- WebApplication.initiate can only be called once. Throw exception on subsequent
  calls.
- Removed implementation of @SubResources, equivalent functionality supported 
  by sub-resource locator methods.
- Removed implementation of @UnmatchedPath, equivalent functionality supported 
  by greedy parameter on @UriTemplate.
- JSON support added to JAXB entity provider for use with "application/json",
  media type. BadgerFish convention is used. Runtime dependency on jettison jar.
- Views refactored to work correctly in combination with HTTP methods
- removed the @SubResource annotation from the examples
- removed Entity class, equivalent functionality is supported by the 
  javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders class
- Bookmark example added
- include 311 API distribution, src and javadoc
- fixed the formatting of java.util.Date for HTTP-date to conform to RFC 1123
- refactored API/SPI messages
- include jersey API/SPI javadoc
- URIs and URI templates with escaped space character throw exception for 
  URI.create, found by Julian Reschke:
  https://jersey.dev.java.net/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=1 
- include version information in manifest of jersey.jar

release 0.1 (2007-06-19)
