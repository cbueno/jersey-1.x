    <name>JSR250 API library repackaged as OSGi bundle</name>
    <description>
JSR250 API library repackaged as OSGi bundle is intended for test purpose only.
It should not be deployed to a public maven repository to avoid confusion.
When deploying Jersey, the release profile (-Prelease command line option) has to be switched on
to avoid including this module and related tests.
