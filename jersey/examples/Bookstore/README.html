    <h1>Bookstore Example</h1>
    <p>This example demonstrates how to connect JSP pages to resources. The example is copied from
       the <a href="https://stapler.dev.java.net/getting-started.html">Bookstore</a> example presented
       by the <a href="https://stapler.dev.java.net/">Stapler</a> project that provides a way to staple
       URIs to Java classes to build RESTful Web applications such as <a href="http://hudson.dev.java.net/">Hudson</a>.
    </p>
    <p>A bookstore Web application is presented that is capable of presenting books, CDs and tracks of CDs.
     
    </p>

    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <p>The example consists of four web resources implemented by the following:
        </p><dl>
            <dt><code>com.sun.ws.rest.samples.bookstore.resources.Bookstore</code></dt>
            <dd>The bookstore resource that returns a list of items, either CDs or Books.
                The resource dynamically references a Book or CD resource using the
                getItem method that is annotated with Path.
                The Book and CD resource both inherit from the Item class and thus the
                resources can be managed ploymorphically.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>com.sun.ws.rest.samples.bookstore.resources.Book</code></dt>
            <dd>The book resource that has a title and an author.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>com.sun.ws.rest.samples.bookstore.resources.CD</code></dt>
            <dd>The CD resource that has a title, author and a list of tracks.
                The resource dynamically references the Track resource using the
                getTrack method that is annotated with Path.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>com.sun.ws.rest.samples.bookstore.resources.Track</code></dt>
            <dd>The Tracks resource that has a name and the length of the track.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    <p>The mapping of the URI path space is presented in the following table:</p>
	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>URI path</th>
	<th>Resource class</th>
	<th>HTTP methods</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/</td>
	<td>Bookstore</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/count</td>
	<td>Bookstore</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/time</td>
	<td>Bookstore</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/items/{itemid}</td>
	<td>Book, CD</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>/items/{itemid}/tracks/{num}</td>
	<td>Track</td>
	<td>GET</td>
	</tr>

	</table>

    <p>The mapping of the views to URI paths and JSP pages is presented in the following table:</p>
	<table border="1">
	<tr>
	<th>View</th>
	<th>URI path</th>
	<th>JSP page</th>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>Bookstore:index.jsp</td>
	<td>/</td>
	<td>/com/sun/ws/rest/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/index.jsp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Bookstore:count.jsp</td>
	<td>/count</td>
	<td>/com/sun/ws/rest/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/count.jsp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Bookstore:time.jsp</td>
	<td>/time</td>
	<td>/com/sun/ws/rest/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/time.jsp</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
	<td>Book:index.jsp</td>
	<td>/items/{itemid}</td>
	<td>/com/sun/ws/rest/samples/bookstore/resources/Book/index.jsp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>CD:index.jsp</td>
	<td>/items/{itemid}</td>
	<td>/com/sun/ws/rest/samples/bookstore/resources/CD/index.jsp</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	<td>Track:index.jsp</td>
	<td>/items/{itemid}/tracks/{num}</td>
	<td>/com/sun/ws/rest/samples/bookstore/resources/Track/index.jsp</td>
	</tr>

	</table>
    <h2>Running the Example</h2>

    
      <p>Bookmark example runs on Glassfish V2 application server (<a href="http://glassfish.dev.java.net/">http://glassfish.dev.java.net</a>). You will need to have it installed in order to run the example.

      <p>Run the example as follows, having <code>$AS_HOME</code> poining to your Glassfish home directory:</p>

      <p>Build and deploy the project by executing ant from the project directory</p>
      <blockquote><code>ant run-on-glassfish</code></blockquote>

      <p>Goto the URL:<p>
      <blockquote><code>http://&lt;host:port&gt;/Bookstore/</code></blockquote>

      <p>For a default glassfish installation will it be:<p>
      <blockquote><a href="http://localhost:8080/Bookstore/">http://localhost:8080/Bookstore/</a></blockquote>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>This example shows how to support polymorphism of resources and JSP pages.
         Hence it is possible to add another resource, such as a DVD resource with associated JSP pages,
         which extends Item without having to change the logic of Bookstore or the existing JSP pages.</p>
      <p>Each relative JSP page referenced using the Views annotation declared on a resource class corresponds to:
      <ul>
      <li>a relative URI path (relative to the URI path of the class) that corresponds to the name of the JSP page minus the '.jsp' suffix; or
      </li>
      <li>the 'index.jsp" that corresponds to the URI path of the class.
      </ul>
      <p>A relative JSP page is resolved by converting the fully qualified class name of the resource class into a path
         and appending the name of JSP page to that path. For example, when a GET is performed on the URI path "/"
         then the relative JSP page is "index.jsp" as referenced by the Bookstore resource class. This is resolved
         to "/com/sun/ws/rest/samples/bookstore/resources/Bookstore/index.jsp" that resides in the Web pages of the WAR.
         Similarly when a GET is performed on URI path "/count" then the relative JSP page is "count.jsp" as referenced by 
         Bookstore resource class.
      </p>
      <p>The runtime fowards to the absolute JSP page using the servlet RequestDispatcher.forward method. The variable "it"
         is automatically set to the instance of Bookstore so that the index.jsp, or count.jsp, has access to the Bookstore instance as
         a Java bean.
      </p>
      <p>If a resource class inherits from another resource class then it will automatically inherit the views from the super class.</p>
      <p>A JSP page may also include views using the inheritance mechanism, for example the index,jsp page associated with the
         Book resource class includes a footer.jsp page whoose location is specified by the super class, Item.
