Build the project, generate the resourcedoc.xml with javadoc and generate the wadl file:
$ mvn compile javadoc:javadoc com.sun.jersey:maven-wadl-plugin:generate

Afterwards have a look at the target/classes/application.wadl.

Have a look at these artifacts:
- pom.xml:
  How all this wadl generation stuff is configured

- src/main/java/com/sun/jersey/samples/generatewadl/resources/ItemsResource.java:
  Shows how custom javadoc tags can be used to extend the generated wadl documentation
  
- src/main/java/com/sun/jersey/samples/generatewadl/util/ExampleDocProcessor.java:
  Shows how you can process your custom tags and add them to the generated resourcedoc.xml.
  An "@example.tag" can be found at ItemsResource.createItem.
  
- src/main/java/com/sun/jersey/samples/generatewadl/util/ExampleWadlGenerator:
  Shows how the custom information added by the ExampleDocProcessor to the resourcedoc.xml
  can be processed by this WadlGenerator and used to extend the generated application.wadl
