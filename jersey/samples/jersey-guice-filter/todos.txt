1) Create a README.html file which describes the following elements of the sample:

       a) Explain web.xml and GuiceServletConfig

       b) Create resource class, @Path("bound/perrequest"), using guice @RequestScoped

       c) Inject URI info and a query parameter

       d) Create singleton component and inject into resource at construction

2) Add the sample to the modules of jersey-samples (once the README is done)
    and remove the exclude clause referring to the sample at the samples/assembly.xml file

3) Also, check that it works properly with other container types like EmbeddedGF, External GlassFish, etc.

4) Remove the overriding of test container in the test class.
